# Serverless Application with AWS Lambda

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a serverless application using AWS Lambda, focusing on serverless computing to manage backend tasks without the need for traditional server management.

## Objectives

- Understand and implement serverless computing concepts.
- Build backend functionality using AWS Lambda.
- Utilize AWS API Gateway, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch for a complete serverless solution.

## Skills Required

- AWS Lambda
- Serverless Computing
- Backend Development
- Event-driven Programming
- Node.js

## Tools & Technologies

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service for running code in response to events.
- **AWS API Gateway**: Manage and configure APIs to trigger Lambda functions.
- **AWS S3**: Object storage service for storing files.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: NoSQL database service for data storage.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for Lambda function code.
- **Git**: Version control system.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Code editor.

## Project Requirements

1. **Backend Logic**
   - Create and deploy AWS Lambda functions to handle backend tasks.

2. **API Gateway Setup**
   - Configure AWS API Gateway to trigger Lambda functions based on HTTP requests.

3. **Data Storage**
   - Use AWS DynamoDB for storing and retrieving application data.

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Configure environment variables and set permissions for Lambda functions.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling and logging using AWS CloudWatch.

## Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy Lambda Functions**
   - Deploy Lambda functions using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
   - Ensure that your functions are set up to be triggered by API Gateway.

4. **Configure API Gateway**
   - Set up API Gateway to route HTTP requests to your Lambda functions.

5. **Set Up DynamoDB**
   - Create DynamoDB tables via the AWS Management Console and configure them for use with Lambda functions.

6. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Define environment variables in the AWS Management Console for your Lambda functions.

7. **Enable Logging**
   - Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor logs and metrics for your Lambda functions.

## Usage Instructions

- Test your Lambda functions through API Gateway endpoints.
- Check data storage and retrieval from DynamoDB.
- Monitor logs and errors via AWS CloudWatch.
